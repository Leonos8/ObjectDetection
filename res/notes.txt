Take images -> Extract HOG features which will be length 3780 -> Take SVM Coefficients which will be of length 3780 -> multiply
the HOG features and SVM coefficients together -> 3780*3780+b=1(H)/-1(NH)

Sliding Window:
Take box of 64x128 -> extract window of that size in top left corner -> take hog features -> supply it to SVM -> Identifies whether
that window is human or not -> Slides window one pixel to the right -> repeat the process until reaching the end of the row ->
repeat process one pixel down -> you will be able to get the X and Y coordinates of the person because you will know the how many
pixels the sliding window has moved -> What if sliding window doesnt enclose the person completely -> use technique called image
pyramid

Image Pyramid:
Use the sliding window on top of the image -> extract some objects that match the size -> Downscale the image and repeat the sliding
window technique ->Repeat until the person is identified and encapsulated -> Dalal and Triggs have identified you can use up to
6 scales and with reasonable confidence locate objects of different sizes and different scales -> Then use NMS technique

Build loading screen that lists what features are loaded like how far into specific process. then open into camera jframe
